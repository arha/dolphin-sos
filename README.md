# dolphin SOS
Sends an SOS CW (morse code) message on 434.0MHz. Works against flipperzero api 0.70.1.

By default, the message transmitted is SMS (••• –– •••) which you might know as the nokia SMS tune. 

The message can be toggled between "SMS" and "SOS" by pressing: left, right, left, right, left, right, enter. 

# technical details

* Currently sending on 434.0 MHz and nothing else. I doubt anyone will even tune to ISM for CW, or consider an ISM-band CW signal anything serious, so I wouldn't rely on flipper for emergencies.
* WPM timing is 166ms per dit. The PARIS system places it at 6-7 WPM. This was chosen so that a trained receiver can assume that the transmitter is not proficient in keying morse code and that he actually uses ISM bands as a real emergency. A good fist (well spaced, fast morse signal) on ISM might seem like a joke than a real emergency
* SOS is a prosign and can be sent without spaces between letters.

# todo

* change freqs and retune
* continuous channel marker for RDF
* maybe CW out some other message, your ID, emergency phone number, callsign, etc
* alter WPM
* adding a bit of randomness (bad fist) might help the receiver assume this isn't another ISM device, but there's an actual human behind it in a real emergency
